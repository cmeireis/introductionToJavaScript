Exercise 1
What does this code log to the console? Does executing the foo function affect the output? Why or why not?
  let bar = 1;
function foo() {
  let bar = 2;
}

foo();
console.log(bar);

  The value output to the console would be 1.  Executing foo doesn't impact the output because bar is set in foo which is inner scope.
Exercise 2
  See greeter.js file in Input_Output section.

Exercise 3
  See multipy.js file.
Exercise 4
  See factorial.js file.
Exercise 5
What does the following code log to the console?

function scream(words) {
  words = words + '!!!!';
  return;
  console.log(words);
}

scream('Yipeee');

  I initially thought this would return Yippeee!!!! 
  After trying it I found it doesn't return anything due to return happening before console.log()

Exercise 6
What does the following code log to the console?
  function scream(words) {
  return words + '!!!!';
}

scream('Yipeee')
  It logs nothing because of no console.log() statement.  It would return a value though.
