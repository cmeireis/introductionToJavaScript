The following code causes an infinite loop (a loop that never stops iterating). Why?
let counter = 0;

while (counter = 1) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter += 1;

  if (counter > 2) {
    break;
  }
}
The condition counter = 1 always evaluates to truthy.  It never satisfies the if statement because counter never goes greater than 2.

Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does this code send to the console?
for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}
It will not error.  The second line does increment i by 1, so it will log out 1 through 5.


  The following code uses a randomNumberBetween function to generate a number between its first and second arguments. It uses a while loop to try to generate a number greater than 2. Refactor the code so that you don't need to call randomNumberBetween from two different locations, lines 6 and 10. Do not change the arguments you pass to randomNumberBetween.

function randomNumberBetween(min, max) {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min);
}

let tries = 0;
let result;

do {
    result = randomNumberBetween(1, 6);
    tries += 1;
} while (result <= 2);
}

console.log('It took ' + String(tries) + ' tries to get a number greater than 2');


Exercise 6 - using recursion for the factorial problem:

function times(number) {
  if (number <= 1) {
    return 1;
  }

  return number * times(number - 1);
}
